# CSCI483Assignment2
Assignment 2 for CSCI483 at StFX

My intention for this assignment was to use a text file based system to store user profiles
and their article reviews, as I had spent over 6 hours attempting to get a database set up 
and working to no avail. 
My design behind my website was as follows:
 - A login page which will either take you to a registration page, or to the page holding the reviews.
 - A registration page, to create a user profile, redirects you to the reviews page, once registered
 - A reviews page, to hold all the user submitted reviews
 - A review editor page, to create the reviews for the review page, per user profile
